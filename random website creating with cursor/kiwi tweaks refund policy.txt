### **Refund Terms**

By purchasing any virtual product from our Website, you acknowledge and accept the terms of this Refund Policy.

### **Virtual Products Overview**  
We offer virtual products for sale, namely the [Kiwi Premium Tweaking Utility] and [Kiwi Standard Tweaking Utility]. These products are digital in nature and are delivered electronically without any physical shipment.

### **Refund Criteria**  
As our products are digital, we typically do not offer refunds after a purchase is made. However, we understand that certain situations might warrant exceptions. Refund requests will be reviewed individually.  
Because our products are permanent unless reverted by the user, they can be subject to abuse, so we have a stringent refund policy in place.

### **How to Request a Refund**  
If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact us through email or Discord (@kiwitweaks) **within 7 days** of your purchase date. To process your request, include the following:  
- Your purchase details.  
- A short description of why you're requesting a refund.  
- Any relevant video or images showing the issue, if applicable.  

Once we receive your request, we will assess it and inform you of our decision regarding your refund.

### **Refund Exclusions**  
**Change of Mind:**  
Refunds will not be granted if you simply change your mind or no longer want the product after making a purchase.

**Tampering Policy:**  
Any attempt to alter, reverse engineer, or tamper with the software in any form, including decompiling, cracking, or modifying the underlying code, will result in immediate termination of your license and a permanent ban from our customer Discord.

### **Refund Processing**  
**Approval Process:**  
Refunds are subject to approval based on your specific case.  
**Refund Method:**  
If your refund request is approved, the refund will be processed through the original payment method. Please allow up to **10 business days** for the refund to be reflected in your account.

### **Changes to the Policy**  
We reserve the right to update or modify this Refund Policy at any time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page shows when the policy was last revised. By continuing to use our Website or purchasing virtual products, you agree to the updated terms.
