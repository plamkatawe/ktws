                    <h3>Refund Terms</h3>
                    <p>By purchasing any virtual product from our Website, you acknowledge and accept the terms of this Refund Policy.</p>

                    <h3>Virtual Products Overview</h3>
                    <p>We offer virtual products for sale, namely the [Kiwi Premium Tweaking Utility] and [Kiwi Standard Tweaking Utility]. These products are digital in nature and are delivered electronically without any physical shipment.</p>

                    <h3>Refund Criteria</h3>
                    <p>As our products are digital, we typically do not offer refunds after a purchase is made. However, we understand that certain situations might warrant exceptions. Refund requests will be reviewed individually.<br>
                    Because our products are permanent unless reverted by the user, they can be subject to abuse, so we have a stringent refund policy in place.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #4eff91;">How to Request a Refund</h3>
                    <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact us through email or Discord (@kiwitweaks) <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: bold;">within 7 days</span> of your purchase date. To process your request, include the following:</p>

                    <p><strong>Tampering Policy:</strong><br>
                    Any attempt to alter, reverse engineer, or tamper with the software in any form, including decompiling, cracking, or modifying the underlying code, will result in immediate termination of your license and a permanent ban from our customer Discord.</p>
